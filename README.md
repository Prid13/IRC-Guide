### Just want to know how to easily download anime through IRC and XDCC _(because your torrent doesn't have any seeds)_ without all the hassle and bs? Follow the easy steps below.

## 1. Download an IRC client/software

You need a client (which basically means a software/program/app) to use IRC/XDCC, before you can download anything. I've tested out a lot of IRC clients to see which one's the easiest to use for our purposes, and I found a simple program called **ClicksAndWhistles**.

2. Click to download the program
