## So, you just want to download the anime you want?

You just discovered an old gem, an obscure anime, or the best fansub out there for a show you like, but you just can't seem to find any good torrents with enough seeds to get the precious files. Out of pure frustration you embark on a long Google journey to find any alternatives or other ways to download the anime you want. After hours and hours of searching, you stumble upon something called IRC/XDCC, and see different fansubs listing them as alternative ways to download their files. But WHAT on Earth is an IRC, and why does it seem almost impossible to just get the files that I want?!?

Trust me, all true anime fans have been there, or at least **I** have, and I'm here to give you the quicket ticket out of your misery by presenting to you this straightforward guide without any cryptic nonsense added to it.

**2018/04/16: CURRENTLY, THIS GUIDE ONLY SHOWS HOW TO DOWNLOAD FROM HATSUYUKI FANSUBS**

## 1. Download an IRC client/software

You need a client (which basically means a software/program/app) to use IRC/XDCC, before you can download anything. I've tested out a lot of IRC clients to see which one's the easiest to use for our purposes, and I found a simple program called **ClicksAndWhistles**.
