## Auto-downloading XDCC

Allright, so you have to download another IRC program that supports auto-accepting downloads (and sets a fixed downloads folder). The easiest one (and free) I found is HexChat.

Download **HexChat** from here: https://hexchat.github.io/downloads.html

> **MAKE SURE YOU CLICK ON Windows 7+ Installer**

> _Because the Windows 10 App is paid, unfortunately._

**INSTRUCTIONS**

1. Just follow the installing wizard (next, next, next, install), and then Run the program.

2. Type in a random nickname

3. Under _Networks,_ click on **`Add`** and type *Rizon*

4. Click on the new Network in the list (Rizon), and click **`Edit`** on the right-side menu

5. Click on where it says _newserver/6667_ at the top, and rename it to **`irc.rizon.net`**

6. Switch from Servers to _Autojoin channels_ (below the list), and then click on **`Add`**

7. Type **`#nibl`** and hit Enter

8. Allright, close the window.

9. While Rizon is highlighted, click on **`Connect`** at the bottom. It will connect to the server and autojoin #nibl channel (where all the good anime files are)

10. Click on **`Settings -> Preferences`** at the top. Click on **`File transfers`** under _Network_ on the left.

11. Under **Auto accept file offers** choose the last option **`Save without interaction`**

12. Change your desired destination folders for the downloads under _Download files to:_ and hit OK when done.

13. Proceed to download the files as you normally would from my [original guide](https://prid13.github.io/IRC-Guide/) and enjoy the auto-downloading :)

Obviously this is not meant to be so easy because auto-accepting files can be dangerous, but hopefully nothing goes wrong since we're only downloading anime files. **But just in case, be sure to close the program when you're done downloading x)**

I hope this helps! :)
