## Auto-downloading XDCC

Allright, so you have to download another IRC program that supports auto-accepting downloads. The easiest one (and free) I found is HexChat.

Download **HexChat** from here: https://hexchat.github.io/downloads.html

> **MAKE SURE YOU CLICK ON Windows 7+ Installer**
>
> _Because the Windows 10 App is paid, unfortunately._

**INSTRUCTIONS**

1. Just follow the installing wizard (next, next, next, install), and then Run the program.

2. Type in a random nickname

3. Under _Networks,_ click on **`Add`** and type *Rizon*

4. Click on the new Network in the list (Rizon), and click **`Edit`** on the right-side menu

5. Click on where it says _newserver/6667_ at the top, and rename it to **`irc.rizon.net`**

6. Switch from Servers to _Autojoin channels_ (below the list), and then click on **`Add`**

7. Type **`#nibl`** and hit Enter

8. Allright, close the window.

9. While Rizon is highlighted, click on **`Connect`** at the bottom. It will connect to the server and autojoin #nibl channel (where all the good anime files are)

10. Allright, here comes the magic. Type in this to enable auto-accept of incoming files and hit enter:

**`/set dcc_auto_recv 2`**

_we're setting the configuration of dcc_auto_recv (XDCC auto receive) to 2, which according to the online manual means that we'll be accepting all incoming file transfers automatically_

11. Click on **`Settings -> Preferences`** at the top. Click on **`File transfers`** under _Network_ on the left. Change your desired destination folders for the downloads under _Download files to:_ and hit OK when done.

12. Proceed to download the files as you normally would from my original guide and enjoy the auto-downloading :)

Obviously this is not meant to be so easy because auto-accepting files can be dangerous, but hopefully nothing goes wrong since we're only downloading anime files. But just in case, be sure to close the program when you're done downloading x)

I hope this helps! :)
